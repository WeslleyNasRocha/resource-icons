# Resource Icons

Resource Icons is a Foundry VTT module that adds customizable icons to tokens to track resources.

## Usage

Resource Icons are configured in the Resources tab of the Token Configuration window.

To activate an icon, select a resource for it to track. To deactivate an icon, select "None."

If no icon image is selected, the default icon image is a white circle.

The border, background, and tint of each icon can be individually set.

The border shape (circle/square) and where the resource icons are anchored (above/below/left of/right of token) can be changed in the module settings (per user with an option to use world default).
